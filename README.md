# AutoClicker-NN
Just autoclicker with GUI for mouse and keyboard

## Download
Donwload AC-NN.zip from [releases](https://github.com/layrexl/AutoClicker-NN/releases), unzip folder and run the AC-NN.exe

## How to use it
By selecting the mouse or keyboard tab, you must configure and fill in everything in it so that there are no empty fields left. After you have done everything, just press the yellow button at the bottom and the program will start waiting for you to press the selected key.
### !! Unfortunately, if you want to reconfigure something after pressing the yellow button, you will have to restart the program, as the program will no longer see your settings after pressing the button. Sorry :( !!
